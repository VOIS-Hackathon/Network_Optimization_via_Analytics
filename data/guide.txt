Analyze network performance data (e.g., latency, dropped calls, bandwidth usage) to identify patterns and anomalies
Underperforming regions
Optimization Techniques

Key Tasks:

Clean and normalize network performance logs

Perform time-series and geospatial analysis to detect anomalies

Use clustering or anomaly detection algorithms to identify problem zones

Build a dashboard with KPIs like average latency, call drop rate, and bandwidth utilization

Provide data-driven recommendations for network upgrades or reconfiguration
